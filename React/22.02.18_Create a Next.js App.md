- ## Next.js: React 프레임워크 <br />

<hr />

- 웹 어플리케이션(4가지)를 Next.js가 제공하고 있다. <br />

  - Code has to be bundled using a _bundler_ like webpack and _transformed_ using a compiler like Babel <br />
  - You need todo production optimizations such as _code splitting_ <br />
  - You might want to statically pre-render some pages for performance and SEO. You might also want to use server-side0rendering or client-side-rendering <br />
  - You might have to write some server-side code to connect your React app to your data store <br />

<hr />

- Next.js 앱 만들기 <br />

  - `npx create-next-app 프로젝트 폴더이름` <br />
  - 개발 서버 실행 `cd 프로젝트 폴더이름` -> `npm run dev` <br />
  - 그러면 포트 3000 에서 Next.js 앱의 "개발 서버"(나중에 자세히 설명)가 시작 <br />
  - 개발 서버를 계속 실행해야 하지만 다시 시작하려면 키 Ctrl + c를 눌러 서버를 중지 <br />
